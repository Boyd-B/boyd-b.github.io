Our sitecore hackathon project attempted to streamline the content editor process of creating a new variant. What we put together was a series of updates to create a single item to organize variant renderings, their variant definitions and their styles. We used the name Components to represent Component based design and development. You can find our work on our [Digital Brewery GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Boyd-B/2018-Digital-Brewery).

### Streamline SXA Series

There are several steps to completing our task. The first of which is to turn sitecore's variants into components. The next parts of this series will explore the pipelines we created to help automate the creation of components and then finally into the modal dialogs to further streamline the creation of matching sass and js files.

* Part 1: Turning variants into components
* Part 2: Adding pipelines to change components location
* Part 3: Adding Modal Dialog wizards
* Part 4: Ideas for improvement

## Part 2: Adding pipelines and updating sitecore items

**Cheers!**
